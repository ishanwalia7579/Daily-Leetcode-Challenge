We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]

Output: 5

Explanation:

The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The longest harmonious subsequences are [1,2], [2,3], and [3,4], all of which have a length of 2.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]

Output: 0

Explanation:

No harmonic subsequence exists.

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
```java

class Solution {
    public int findLHS(int[] nums) {
        int rst = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        // put the number and its occurence in the map
        for (int num : nums) {
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Traverse the map to get the longest harmonious subsequence
        for (int key : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.containsKey(key + 1)) {
                rst = Math.max(rst, map.get(key) + map.get(key + 1));
            }
        }
        return rst;
    }
}
```
