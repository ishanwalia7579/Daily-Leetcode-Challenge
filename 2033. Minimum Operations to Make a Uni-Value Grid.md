Hint
You are given a 2D integer grid of size m x n and an integer x. In one operation, you can add x to or subtract x from any element in the grid.

A uni-value grid is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value. If it is not possible, return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[2,4],[6,8]], x = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can make every element equal to 4 by doing the following: 
- Add x to 2 once.
- Subtract x from 6 once.
- Subtract x from 8 twice.
A total of 4 operations were used.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,5],[2,3]], x = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: We can make every element equal to 3.
Example 3:


Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], x = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to make every element equal.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 105
1 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= x, grid[i][j] <= 104

```c
class Solution {
    fun minOperations(a: Array<IntArray>, x: Int): Int {
        var ans = 0
        var sum = 0
        val b = mutableListOf<Int>()
        
        for (r in a) {
            for (element in r) {
                b.add(element)
                sum += element
            }
        }
        
        b.sort()
        
        for (i in 0 until b.size - 1) {
            if ((b[i + 1] - b[i]) % x != 0) {
                return -1
            }
        }

        val valMedian = b[b.size / 2]
        for (c in b) {
            ans += kotlin.math.abs(valMedian - c) / x
        }
        
        return ans
    }
}

```
