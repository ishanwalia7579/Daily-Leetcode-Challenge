# Leetcode Daily Challenges 
<center><img src="dataset-cover.jpg" width="320px" align="center"></center>

Welcome to my **Leetcode Daily Challenge Repository**! ðŸš€

## About
This repository is dedicated to tracking my daily progress on **Leetcode coding challenges**. Each day, I solve a new problem, analyze its solution, and document the approach and code here. The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and build a robust understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Structure
Each challenge is organized as follows:

- **Date:** The date I solved the challenge.
- **Problem Title:** Name of the challenge with a link to the problem on Leetcode.
- **Solution:** My code implementation in Python (or other languages if applicable).
- **Explanation:** A brief explanation of my approach and the logic behind the solution.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the solutions and approaches in this repository. It can serve as:
- A learning resource for others tackling similar challenges.
- A progress tracker for myself to measure growth over time.

> **Note:** The `Challenges Log` will be updated daily as I complete new problems.

## Goals
- Solve at least one problem every day.
- Document solutions with clear explanations.
- Cover problems across different topics (arrays, strings, graphs, etc.).
- Improve coding speed and accuracy.
