Hint
You are given an integer array nums of size n.

Consider a non-empty subarray from nums that has the maximum possible bitwise AND.

In other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of any subarray of nums. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to k should be considered.
Return the length of the longest such subarray.

The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 3.
The longest subarray with that value is [3,3], so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 4.
The longest subarray with that value is [4], so we return 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 106


```java


class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        // 1) find the global maximum
        int maxVal = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (x > maxVal) maxVal = x;
        }
        
        // 2) scan for the longest consecutive run of maxVal
        int maxLen = 0, currLen = 0;
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (x == maxVal) {
                currLen++;
                if (currLen > maxLen) {
                    maxLen = currLen;
                }
            } else {
                currLen = 0;
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
