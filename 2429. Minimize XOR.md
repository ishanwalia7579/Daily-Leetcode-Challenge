<h2>2429. Minimize XOR</h2> #leetcode #2429
Given two positive integers num1 and num2, find the positive integer x such that:

x has the same number of set bits as num2, and
The value x XOR num1 is minimal.
Note that XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the integer x. The test cases are generated such that x is uniquely determined.

The number of set bits of an integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: num1 = 1, num2 = 12
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0001 and 1100, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 1 = 2 is minimal.
 

<h4>Constraints:</h4>

<li>1 <= num1, num2 <= 109</li>

<h3>Answer</h3>
<h3>Java</h3>

```c
class Solution {
    public int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        int count = Integer.bitCount(num2); 
        int res = 0;

        // Cancel set bits from highest to lowest weight
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0 && count > 0; i--) {
            if ((num1 & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                count--;
                res += (1 << i);
            }
        }

        // Set bits lowest to highest weight
        for (int i = 0; i < 32 && count > 0; i++) {
            if ((num1 & (1 << i)) == 0) {
                count--;
                res += (1 << i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
