<h1>802. Find Eventual Safe States</h1>

There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<img src="picture1.png">
Illustration of graph
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.
 

Constraints:

<li>n == graph.length</li>
<li>1 <= n <= 104</li>
<li>0 <= graph[i].length <= n </li>
<li>0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1</li>
<li>graph[i] is sorted in a strictly increasing order.</li>
<li>The graph may contain self-loops.</li>
<li>The number of edges in the graph will be in the range [1, 4 * 104].</li>

<h3>Kotlin</h3>

 ```c
 class Solution {
    fun eventualSafeNodes(graph: Array<IntArray>): List<Int> {
        val fromToList = MutableList(graph.size) { mutableSetOf<Int>() }
        val toFromList = MutableList(graph.size) { mutableSetOf<Int>() }
        val size = graph.size

        val queue: Queue<Int> = LinkedList()

        for (i in 0 until size) {
            if (graph[i].isEmpty()) {
                queue.add(i)
            }
            for (j in graph[i].indices) {
                fromToList[i].add(graph[i][j])
                toFromList[graph[i][j]].add(i)
            }
        }

        val ans = mutableListOf<Int>()
        while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
            val idx = queue.poll()
            ans.add(idx)

            for (i in toFromList[idx]) {
                fromToList[i].remove(idx)
                if (fromToList[i].isEmpty()) {
                    queue.add(i)
                }
            }
        }
        ans.sort()
        return ans
    }
}

 ```
