Hint
You are given a string word and an integer k.

We consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.

Here, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.

Return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0

Output: 3

Explanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c". Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.

Example 2:

Input: word = "dabdcbdcdcd", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "a" and 1 occurrence of "d". Therefore, word becomes equal to "bdcbdcdcd" where freq('b') == 2, freq('c') == 3, and freq('d') == 4.

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaabaaa", k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "b". Therefore, word becomes equal to "aaaaaa" where each letter's frequency is now uniformly 6.

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 105
0 <= k <= 105
word consists only of lowercase English letters.

```java

class Solution {
    private List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();

    public int minimumDeletions(String word, int k) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        int n = word.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ++freq[word.charAt(i) - 'a'];
        }
        for (int v : freq) {
            if (v > 0) {
                nums.add(v);
            }
        }
        int ans = n;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            ans = Math.min(ans, f(i, k));
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private int f(int v, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (x < v) {
                ans += x;
            } else if (x > v + k) {
                ans += x - v - k;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
