Hint
Given two positive integers n and x.

Return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the xth power of unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique integers [n1, n2, ..., nk] where n = n1x + n2x + ... + nkx.

Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

For example, if n = 160 and x = 3, one way to express n is n = 23 + 33 + 53.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, x = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: We can express n as the following: n = 32 + 12 = 10.
It can be shown that it is the only way to express 10 as the sum of the 2nd power of unique integers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, x = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can express n in the following ways:
- n = 41 = 4.
- n = 31 + 11 = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 300
1 <= x <= 5


```java

class Solution {
    public int numberOfWays(int n, int x) {
        final int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        int[][] f = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        f[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            long k = (long) Math.pow(i, x);
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j) {
                f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j];
                if (k <= j) {
                    f[i][j] = (f[i][j] + f[i - 1][j - (int) k]) % mod;
                }
            }
        }
        return f[n][n];
    }
}
```
