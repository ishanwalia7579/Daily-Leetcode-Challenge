<h1>2342. Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits</h1>

You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers. You can choose two indices i and j, such that i != j, and the sum of digits of the number nums[i] is equal to that of nums[j].

Return the maximum value of nums[i] + nums[j] that you can obtain over all possible indices i and j that satisfy the conditions.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: nums = [18,43,36,13,7]
Output: 54
Explanation: The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the conditions are:
- (0, 2), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 9, and their sum is 18 + 36 = 54.
- (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.
So the maximum sum that we can obtain is 54.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,12,19,14]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no two numbers that satisfy the conditions, so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

<li>1 <= nums.length <= 105</li>
<li>1 <= nums[i] <= 109</li>

<h3>Answer</h3>

```c
class Solution {
    fun maximumSum(nums: IntArray): Int {
        val d = IntArray(100) { 0 }
        var ans = -1

        for (v in nums) {
            var x = 0
            var y = v
            while (y > 0) {
                x += (y % 10)
                y /= 10
            }
            if (d[x] > 0) {
                ans = maxOf(ans, d[x] + v)
            }
            d[x] = maxOf(d[x], v)
        }

        return ans
    }
}
```
