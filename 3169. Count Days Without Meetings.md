Hint
You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

Note: The meetings may overlap.

 

Example 1:

Input: days = 10, meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]

Output: 2

Explanation:

There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.

Example 2:

Input: days = 5, meetings = [[2,4],[1,3]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.

Example 3:

Input: days = 6, meetings = [[1,6]]

Output: 0

Explanation:

Meetings are scheduled for all working days.

 

Constraints:

1 <= days <= 109
1 <= meetings.length <= 105
meetings[i].length == 2
1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days

```c
class Solution {
    fun countDays(days: Int, meetings: Array<IntArray>): Int {
        meetings.sortWith(compareBy { it[0] })
        var ans = 0
        var last = 0
        for (e in meetings) {
            val st = e[0]
            val ed = e[1]
            if (last < st) {
                ans += st - last - 1
            }
            last = maxOf(last, ed)
        }
        ans += days - last
        return ans
    }
}
```
