790. Domino and Tromino Tiling

You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.


Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

```kt
class Solution {
    fun numTilings(n: Int): Int {
        val mod = 1_000_000_007
        var f = LongArray(4)
        f[0] = 1L

        for (i in 1..n) {
            val g = LongArray(4)
            g[0] = (f[0] + f[1] + f[2] + f[3]) % mod
            g[1] = (f[2] + f[3]) % mod
            g[2] = (f[1] + f[3]) % mod
            g[3] = f[0]
            f = g
        }

        return f[0].toInt()
    }
}


```
