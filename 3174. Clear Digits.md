<h1>3174. Clear Digits</h1>

You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.
Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no digit in the string.

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: s = "cb34"

Output: ""

Explanation:

First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".

Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".

 

Constraints:

<li>1 <= s.length <= 100</li>
<li>s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.</li>
<li>The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.</li>
