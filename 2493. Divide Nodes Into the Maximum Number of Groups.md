<h1>2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups</h1>

You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in an undirected graph. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi. Notice that the given graph may be disconnected.

Divide the nodes of the graph into m groups (1-indexed) such that:

Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge [ai, bi], if ai belongs to the group with index x, and bi belongs to the group with index y, then |y - x| = 1.
Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum m) into which you can divide the nodes. Return -1 if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<img src="example1.png">

Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,6],[2,3],[4,6]]
Output: 4
Explanation: As shown in the image we:
- Add node 5 to the first group.
- Add node 1 to the second group.
- Add nodes 2 and 4 to the third group.
- Add nodes 3 and 6 to the fourth group.
We can see that every edge is satisfied.
It can be shown that that if we create a fifth group and move any node from the third or fourth group to it, at least on of the edges will not be satisfied.
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: If we add node 1 to the first group, node 2 to the second group, and node 3 to the third group to satisfy the first two edges, we can see that the third edge will not be satisfied.
It can be shown that no grouping is possible.
 

<h3>Constraints:</h3>

<li>1 <= n <= 500</li>
<li>1 <= edges.length <= 104</li>
<li>edges[i].length == 2</li>
<li>1 <= ai, bi <= n</li>
<li>ai != bi</li>
<li>There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.</li>

```c
import java.util.ArrayDeque
import java.util.Deque

class Solution {
    fun magnificentSets(n: Int, edges: Array<IntArray>): Int {
        val g = Array(n) { mutableListOf<Int>() }
        for (e in edges) {
            val a = e[0] - 1
            val b = e[1] - 1
            g[a].add(b)
            g[b].add(a)
        }
        val d = IntArray(n)
        val dist = IntArray(n)

        for (i in 0 until n) {
            val q: Deque<Int> = ArrayDeque()
            q.offer(i)
            dist.fill(0)
            dist[i] = 1
            var mx = 1
            var root = i

            while (q.isNotEmpty()) {
                val a = q.poll()
                root = minOf(root, a)
                for (b in g[a]) {
                    if (dist[b] == 0) {
                        dist[b] = dist[a] + 1
                        mx = maxOf(mx, dist[b])
                        q.offer(b)
                    } else if (Math.abs(dist[b] - dist[a]) != 1) {
                        return -1
                    }
                }
            }
            d[root] = maxOf(d[root], mx)
        }
        return d.sum()
    }
}

```
