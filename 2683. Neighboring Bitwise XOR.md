<h1>2683. Neighboring Bitwise XOR</h1><br>
A 0-indexed array derived with length n is derived by computing the bitwise XOR (⊕) of adjacent values in a binary array original of length n.

Specifically, for each index i in the range [0, n - 1]:

If i = n - 1, then derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[0].
Otherwise, derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[i + 1].
Given an array derived, your task is to determine whether there exists a valid binary array original that could have formed derived.

Return true if such an array exists or false otherwise.

A binary array is an array containing only 0's and 1's
 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: derived = [1,1,0]
Output: true
Explanation: A valid original array that gives derived is [0,1,0].
derived[0] = original[0] ⊕ original[1] = 0 ⊕ 1 = 1 
derived[1] = original[1] ⊕ original[2] = 1 ⊕ 0 = 1
derived[2] = original[2] ⊕ original[0] = 0 ⊕ 0 = 0
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: derived = [1,1]
Output: true
Explanation: A valid original array that gives derived is [0,1].
derived[0] = original[0] ⊕ original[1] = 1
derived[1] = original[1] ⊕ original[0] = 1
<h3>Example 3:</h3>

Input: derived = [1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no valid original array that gives derived.
 

Constraints:

<li>n == derived.length</li>
<li>1 <= n <= 105</li>
<li>The values in derived are either 0's or 1's</li>

<h3>Java</h3>

```c
class Solution {
    public boolean doesValidArrayExist(int[] derived) {
        int s = 0;
        for (int x : derived) {
            s ^= x;
        }
        return s == 0;
    }
}
```
<h3>Kotlin</h3>

```c
class Solution {
    fun doesValidArrayExist(derived: IntArray): Boolean {
        var s = 0
        for (x in derived) {
            s = s xor x
        }
        return s == 0
    }
}


```

<h3>Python</h3>

```c
class Solution:
    def doesValidArrayExist(self, derived):
        s = 0
        for x in derived:
            s ^= x
        return s == 0


```
