Hint
You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps to num two separate times:

Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).
Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). Note y can be equal to x.
Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.
Let a and b be the two results from applying the operation to num independently.

Return the max difference between a and b.

Note that neither a nor b may have any leading zeros, and must not be 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 555
Output: 888
Explanation: The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888
Example 2:

Input: num = 9
Output: 8
Explanation: The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 108

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDiff(int num) {
        String a = String.valueOf(num);
        String b = a;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); ++i) {
            if (a.charAt(i) != '9') {
                a = a.replace(a.charAt(i), '9');
                break;
            }
        }
        if (b.charAt(0) != '1') {
            b = b.replace(b.charAt(0), '1');
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i < b.length(); ++i) {
                if (b.charAt(i) != '0' && b.charAt(i) != '1') {
                    b = b.replace(b.charAt(i), '0');
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(a) - Integer.parseInt(b);
    }
}
```
