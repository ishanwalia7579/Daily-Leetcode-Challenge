<h1>1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence</h1>

Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.
The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: n = 3
Output: [3,1,2,3,2]
Explanation: [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: n = 5
Output: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]
 

Constraints:

<li>1 <= n <= 20</li>

```c
class Solution {
    fun constructDistancedSequence(n: Int): IntArray {
        val path = IntArray(n * 2)
        val cnt = IntArray(n * 2) { 2 }.apply { this[1] = 1 }

        fun dfs(u: Int): Boolean {
            if (u == n * 2) return true
            if (path[u] != 0) return dfs(u + 1)
            for (i in n downTo 2) {
                if (cnt[i] > 0 && u + i < n * 2 && path[u + i] == 0) {
                    cnt[i] = 0
                    path[u] = i
                    path[u + i] = i
                    if (dfs(u + 1)) return true
                    path[u] = 0
                    path[u + i] = 0
                    cnt[i] = 2
                }
            }
            if (cnt[1] > 0) {
                cnt[1] = 0
                path[u] = 1
                if (dfs(u + 1)) return true
                path[u] = 0
                cnt[1] = 1
            }
            return false
        }

        dfs(1)
        return path.sliceArray(1 until path.size)
    }
