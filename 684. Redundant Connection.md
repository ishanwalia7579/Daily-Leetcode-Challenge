<h1>684. Redundant Connection</h1>

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<img src="reduntant1-1-graph.jpg">

Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<img src="reduntant1-2-graph.jpg">
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
 

Constraints:

<li>n == edges.length</li>
<li>3 <= n <= 1000</li>
<li>edges[i].length == 2</li>
<li>1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length</li>
<li>ai != bi</li>
<li>There are no repeated edges.</li>
<li>The given graph is connected.</li>

<h3>Kotlin</h3>

```c
class Solution {
    private lateinit var parent: IntArray

    fun findRedundantConnection(edges: Array<IntArray>): IntArray {
        val n = edges.size
        parent = IntArray(n + 1)

        for (i in 1..n) {
            parent[i] = i // Initialize parent
        }

        for (edge in edges) {
            val u = edge[0]
            val v = edge[1]
            if (find(u) == find(v)) {
                return edge // Found a cycle
            }
            union(u, v)
        }
        return intArrayOf(-1, -1) // Should not reach here
    }

    private fun find(u: Int): Int {
        if (parent[u] != u) {
            parent[u] = find(parent[u]) // Path compression
        }
        return parent[u]
    }

    private fun union(u: Int, v: Int) {
        parent[find(u)] = find(v)
    }
}

```
