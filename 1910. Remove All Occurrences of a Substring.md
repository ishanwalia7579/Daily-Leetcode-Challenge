<h1>1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring</h1>

Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
Output: "dab"
Explanation: The following operations are done:
- s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 2, so s = "dabaabcbc".
- s = "dabaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 4, so s = "dababc".
- s = "dababc", remove "abc" starting at index 3, so s = "dab".
Now s has no occurrences of "abc".
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"
Output: "ab"
Explanation: The following operations are done:
- s = "axxxxyyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 4 so s = "axxxyyyb".
- s = "axxxyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 3 so s = "axxyyb".
- s = "axxyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 2 so s = "axyb".
- s = "axyb", remove "xy" starting at index 1 so s = "ab".
Now s has no occurrences of "xy".
 

Constraints:

<li>1 <= s.length <= 1000</li>
<li>1 <= part.length <= 1000</li>
<li>s​​ and part consists of lowercase English letters.</li>

<h3>Answer</h3>

<h3>Kotlin</h3>

```c

class Solution {
    fun removeOccurrences(s: String, part: String): String {
        var result = s
        while (result.contains(part)) {
            result = result.replaceFirst(part, "")
        }
        return result
    }
}

```
