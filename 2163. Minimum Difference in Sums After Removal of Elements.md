Hint
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.

You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:

The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.
The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.

For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.
Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.
 

Constraints:

nums.length == 3 * n
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 105

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumDifference(vector<int>& a) {
        vector<long long> mns(a.size());
        int n = a.size() / 3;
        multiset<int, std::greater<int>> st;
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) {
            st.insert(a[i]);
            sum += a[i];
        }
        mns[n-1] = sum;
        for (int i=n; i<2*n; ++i) {
            sum += a[i];
            st.insert(a[i]);
            sum -= *st.begin();
            st.erase(st.begin());
            mns[i] = sum;
        }

        multiset<int> sm;
        sum = 0;
        for (int i=3*n-1; i>=2*n; --i) {
            sum += a[i];
            sm.insert(a[i]);
        }
        long long ans = mns[2*n-1] - sum;
        for (int i=2*n-1; i>=n; --i) {
            sum += a[i];
            sm.insert(a[i]);
            sum -= *sm.begin();
            sm.erase(sm.begin());
            ans = min(ans, mns[i-1]-sum);
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
};

```
