Hint
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string "3322251" we replace "33" with "23", replace "222" with "32", replace "5" with "15" and replace "1" with "11". Thus the compressed string becomes "23321511".

Given a positive integer n, return the nth element of the count-and-say sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: "1211"

Explanation:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = RLE of "1" = "11"
countAndSay(3) = RLE of "11" = "21"
countAndSay(4) = RLE of "21" = "1211"
Example 2:

Input: n = 1

Output: "1"

Explanation:

This is the base case.

 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 30

 ```

class Solution {
    fun countAndSay(n: Int): String {
        if (n == 1) return "1" // Base case
        
        // Recursively get the previous sequence
        val previous = countAndSay(n - 1)
        val stringBuilder = StringBuilder()
        var count = 1
        
        // Iterate through the previous sequence
        for (i in 1 until previous.length) {
            if (previous[i] == previous[i - 1]) {
                count++ // Count consecutive characters
            } else {
                // Append the count and the character
                stringBuilder.append(count).append(previous[i - 1])
                count = 1 // Reset count for the new character
            }
        }
        
        // Append the last sequence
        stringBuilder.append(count).append(previous[previous.length - 1])
        
        return stringBuilder.toString()
    }
}

// Example usage
fun main() {
    val solution = Solution()
    println(solution.countAndSay(4)) // Output: "1211"
}
```
